He then told us that he, once, accompanied Imam al-Sadiq (as) to this very place where the Imam (‘a) did the same thing that Safwan had just done and said the same supplication. Safwan added, “The Imam (‘a) then advised me to persist in this method and form of Ziyarah and to visit Imam `Ali and Imam al-Husayn (as) with this form, for he would guarantee, on behalf of Almighty Allah, that any one who visits them with this form of ziyarah and says this supplication, be it from close or far distance, will have his ziyarah accepted, his efforts rewarded, his greetings conveyed (to the Imams) without any barrier, and his requests granted by Almighty Allah whatever they are.”"

He stood at the tomb, wept, and pronounced the following words (this ziyarat). \nImam al-Baqir (AS) then added, “Indeed, any one of our adherents (Shi`ah) who pronounces these words at the tomb of Ameer al-Mu'mineen (AS) or the tomb of one of the Imams (AS) shall certainly have his prayer lifted up on a ladder of light, carrying the seal of the Holy Prophet's (SAWW) ring, and it shall be kept so until it will be delivered to the Riser from Muhammad's (SAWW) Household (namely, Imam al-Mahdi (AJTFS)) who will receive the reciter of that prayer with good tidings, greetings, and honor.”\n\nZiyarah of Ameenullah is considered one of the general forms of Ziyarah of Imam `Ali (as), one of the forms of Ziyarah on the Eid al-Ghadir Day, and one of the comprehensive forms of Ziyarah that can be said at all the shrines of the Holy Imams.\n\nthe Ziyarah of Ameenullah is considered one of the general forms of Ziyarah of Imam `Ali (as), one of the forms of Ziyarah on the Eid al-Ghadir Day, and one of the comprehensive forms of Ziyarah that can be said at all the shrines of the Holy Imams.\n\nThis Ziyarat is one of those Ziyarats that has been recited by Imam Mahdi (A.S.) himself, as mentioned in the incident of the visitation of Haj Ali Baghdadi.\n\nImam Mahdi (A.S.), in the incident of meeting Haj Ali Baghdadi, clearly states that and emphasis that: this Ziyarat is the best of all Ziyarats.\n\nA significant point that can be comprehended from that incident is that this Ziyarat belongs to the group of comprehensive and general Ziyarats that can be recited for all the Imams and in the shrines of each one of them; just as his holiness recited this Ziyarat in the holy shrines of Imam Kazim and Imam Jawad (peace be upon them) in the city of Kazmayn. In fact, this point has been clearly stated even in the narration of Imam Baqir (A.S.)\n\nLate Mohaddis e Qummi says: This Ziyarat hold absolute authority, and has arrived in all the books of supplications and Ziyarats."

It is also recommended to be recited to obtain relief from oppression.\n\nMafatih al-Jinan: Ziyarat Aal-i Yasin The honorable Shaykh Ahmad ibn Abi Talib Tabrisi in his valuable work (called) al-Ihtijaj has related that in his letter to Muhammad Himyari, answering the questions raised by him, Imam Mahdi (`a) wrote, \"In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.

After you point to Imam al-Husayn (peace be upon him) with greetings and offer the two-unit prayer, you may say the Takbir statement (i.e. allahu-akbar) and then say... (the forthcoming form of Ziyarah). If you do so, you will have said the prayer that is said by the angels who visit Imam al-Husayn (peace be upon him). You will be also raised one hundred million ranks to join the rank of those who were martyred with him (i.e. Imam al-Husayn) and you will be included with their group. You will, moreover, be awarded the reward of the visiting of all Prophets and Messengers as well as the reward of all the visitors of Imam al-Husayn (peace be upon him) since the day of his martyrdom.”"

For that reason, it is known as the Ziyarat that was issued from the sacred side (Ziyarat al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa).[1] One of the most important features of this Ziyarat is that in different phrases, Imam al-Mahdi (PBUH) graphically describes the events of Ashura and the agony that Imam al-Husain (PBUH) and his family faced on that horrific and ominous day.\n\nThe text of the Ziyarat al-Nahiya is found in some early Ziyarat collections such as al-Mazar al-Kabir, by Muhammad Ibn Ja'far al-Mash'hadi, pp. 496-513. It is also reported in al-Mazar, by al-Mufid as mentioned in Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 98, pp. 318-329.\n\nIt should be noted that there is another Ziyarat known as al-Nahiya, which focuses on the Ziyarat of other martyrs of Karbala, specifying the names of the companions of Imam al-Husain (PBUH). However, as mentioned by al-Majlisi, the time mentioned in the documentation of the Hadith as the time of its release is four years before the time of the birth of Imam al-Mahdi (PBUH). Assuming that it was not a transcription error, that particular Ziyarat may have been transmitted by Imam Hasan al-Askari (PBUH) (Imam Mahdi's father, the eleventh Imam), not Imam Mahdi (PBUH). In that case, al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa (the sacred place) refers to the house of Imam Hasan al-Askari (PBUH) in Samarra."

        "description": "The Major Comprehensive Form of Ziyarah\n\nThis ziyarah is unique in its way of narration and speaks of the incredible status of the Ahl ul-Bayt (peace be upon them) in the eyes of God.\n\n`Allamah al-Majlisi, says this form of ziyarah is considered the most sublime comprehensive forms in text, chain of authority, eloquence, and lucidity. In his commentary on Man-la-Yahduruhul-Faqih,`Allamah al-Majlisi's father has mentioned that this form of ziyarah is the most excellent and most perfect form and that as long as he would be in a shrine of any of the Holy Imams (peace be upon them), he would say no other form than this one.\n\nThis ziyarah has been reported by Shaykh al-Saduq in his two books of Man-la-Yahduruhul-Faqih and `Uyun Akhbar al-Rida as follows: Musa ibn `Abdullah al-Nakha`i is reported to have asked  Imam `Ali al-Naqi al-Hadi (peace be upon him), saying, “O son of Allah's Messenger! Please teach me a comprehensively eloquent ziarat that I may say whenever I visit any of you (i.e. the Holy Imams).” Imam Mahdi (A.S.) has reminded about this ziarat thrice Jameah! Jameah! Jameah! For recitation by all his lovers and followers as mentioned by Haji Nuri in Najm- us –Saqeb, p 243\n\nTHE APPRAISAL OF OUR MASTER, IMAM MAHDI (A.S.) FROM ZIYARAT JAMIA KABEERA Majlisi (R.A.), the first, says regarding the Ziyarat Jamia Kabeera that:\nIn my true dream, I visited Imam Reza (A.S.), who approved of this manner and regarded it as good. When I visited Imam Ali (A.S.) and began to fight my inner self in the vicinity of his holy shrine, with the grace of his holiness, Allah opened the doors of spiritual contemplations for me. Such revelations which cannot be endured by weak intellects.\nIn that state of spiritual contemplation - or you can call it the world between the states of sleep and awakening- while I was sitting in the courtyard of Imran, I found myself in Samarra. I witnessed the shrines of those two noble Imams (A.S.) with utter sublimity and beauty, and I saw a green covering on the graves of those two honorable men, which was from the clothes of the inhabitants of heaven, and I hadn't seen anything like it in this world.\nMeanwhile, I saw our Master, and the Master of all the humans, Imam Mahdi (A.S.), behind the grave, sitting in the direction of the shrine's gate. Upon witnessing his holiness, I began to recite Ziyarat Jamia with a loud voice, like those panegyrists. After I completed the recitation of the Ziyarat, his holiness said: It was a good Ziyarat.\nI politely said: O' my Master, my soul be sacrificed on you! This is the Ziyarat of your honorable grandfather, the Ziyarat that has reached us from the holy threshold of your grandfather Imam Hadi (A.S.), and I indicated towards his grave.\nHe replied: Yes, come in.\nAfter entering, I stood near the gate.\nHe said: Come forward.\nI said: My Master, I fear of being disrespectful, and of having committed infidelity.\nHe said: If this act is done with our permission, there is no problem.\nI walked a little ahead, and was frightened and shivering.\nHe said: Come forward.\nThen I moved forward to such an extent that I was standing near his holiness.\nHe said: Sit down.\nI replied: My Master, I am afraid.\nHe said: Don't be afraid.\nI sat just like a servant sits in front of his master.\nHe said: Be at ease, and sit comfortably. You are tired. You have arrived here walking and barefooted.\nIn short, his holiness bestowed his grace upon his servant, and had an invaluable conversation with him, the description of which is not possible here. And I have forgotten most part of it. Then I woke up from my dream and on that holy day, prepared the provisions of my Ziyarat, though the path was blocked from a long time, and great obstacles were to be faced through the way, but it opened by Allah's grace, and all the obstacles were removed. I was able to walk barefooted for the Ziyarat, just as his holiness had said.\nI stayed for that night inside the shrine and recited this Ziyarat several times. That night, on my way to the holy shrine, I witnessed numerous strange incidents. In fact, in better words, several astonishing miracles appeared before me, whose description will be quite lengthy.\nTo summarize it, I am doubtless that this Ziyarat has reached us from Imam Hadi (A.S.) and Imam Mahdi (A.S.) has approved of it. It is the best and the most comprehensive of all the Ziyarats. After the dream I saw, most of the time, I visit the Imams reciting this very Ziyarat, i.e. the Ziyarat Jamia. And I haven't visited those holy personalities in their holy shrine without reciting this Ziyarat. Therefore, I delayed the explanation and commentary of all the other Ziyarats in order to explain the virtue of this noble Ziyarat.\n--- Dar us Salaam: 2/43 ."

It is however acceptable to say the following (form of ziyarah) at all shrines.”\n\nThis apparently means that it is acceptable to say this form of ziyarah at visiting the holy shrines of the Imams (peace be upon them) or even all other holy shrines, like those of the Prophets and the Prophet's successors"
