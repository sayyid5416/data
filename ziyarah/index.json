After you point to Imam al-Husayn (peace be upon him) with greetings and offer the two-unit prayer, you may say the Takbir statement (i.e. allahu-akbar) and then say... (the forthcoming form of Ziyarah). If you do so, you will have said the prayer that is said by the angels who visit Imam al-Husayn (peace be upon him). You will be also raised one hundred million ranks to join the rank of those who were martyred with him (i.e. Imam al-Husayn) and you will be included with their group. You will, moreover, be awarded the reward of the visiting of all Prophets and Messengers as well as the reward of all the visitors of Imam al-Husayn (peace be upon him) since the day of his martyrdom.”"

For that reason, it is known as the Ziyarat that was issued from the sacred side (Ziyarat al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa).[1] One of the most important features of this Ziyarat is that in different phrases, Imam al-Mahdi (PBUH) graphically describes the events of Ashura and the agony that Imam al-Husain (PBUH) and his family faced on that horrific and ominous day.\n\nThe text of the Ziyarat al-Nahiya is found in some early Ziyarat collections such as al-Mazar al-Kabir, by Muhammad Ibn Ja'far al-Mash'hadi, pp. 496-513. It is also reported in al-Mazar, by al-Mufid as mentioned in Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 98, pp. 318-329.\n\nIt should be noted that there is another Ziyarat known as al-Nahiya, which focuses on the Ziyarat of other martyrs of Karbala, specifying the names of the companions of Imam al-Husain (PBUH). However, as mentioned by al-Majlisi, the time mentioned in the documentation of the Hadith as the time of its release is four years before the time of the birth of Imam al-Mahdi (PBUH). Assuming that it was not a transcription error, that particular Ziyarat may have been transmitted by Imam Hasan al-Askari (PBUH) (Imam Mahdi's father, the eleventh Imam), not Imam Mahdi (PBUH). In that case, al-Nahiya al-Muqaddasa (the sacred place) refers to the house of Imam Hasan al-Askari (PBUH) in Samarra."

According to the traditions, \"Aal-e-Yaseen\" is equivalent to \"Aal-e-Muhammad(peace be upon them)\" and is the correct pronunciation (Qira'at) of verse 37:130 of the Holy Quran. Beside its superb beauty, one of the interesting points about this Duaa is that, in it, we confess all the central beliefs one by one. It is also recommended to be recited to obtain relief from oppression.\n\nMafatih al-Jinan: Ziyarat Aal-i Yasin The honorable Shaykh Ahmad ibn Abi Talib Tabrisi in his valuable work (called) al-Ihtijaj has related that in his letter to Muhammad Himyari, answering the questions raised by him, Imam Mahdi (`a) wrote, \"In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. Neither you understand His affair, nor do you accept from His friends, Mature wisdom; - but (the preaching of) Warners profits them not, (from those who have not faith), peace be upon us and all righteous servants of Allah. Whenever you want to pay attention to God through us and also to us, recite the following as God has said:\" (Allahumma inna hadhihi buq`atun tahhartaha...)\"\n\nAnother entrance leave: Allamah Majlisi has cited an entrance leave from an old manuscript that begins with \"O Allah!
