        "DESC: During my journey with him to al-Kufah for meeting Abu-Ja`far al-Mansur the `Abbasid ruler, Imam Ja`far al-Sadiq (as) asked me to make our camels kneel down at a certain place, saying, “This is the tomb of my grandfather, the Commander of the Faithful.” As I made the camels kneel down there, he rode off, bathed himself, changed his clothes, took off his shoes, and ordered me to imitate him in everything. He then directed towards the hillock of Najaf (al-dhakwah), saying, “If you walk in short steps and nod your head to the ground, you shall be given one hundred thousand rewards for each step, one hundred thousand sins shall be erased from your sins, you shall be elevated one hundred thousand ranks, one hundred thousand of your requests shall be granted, and you shall be granted the rewards of all veracious individuals who died and all martyrs whom were slain.”",
        "DESC: Imam al-Sadiq (as) then walked with tranquility and gravity, and I followed him, pronouncing statements of glorification and sanctification of Almighty Allah and confession of His Oneness until we reached the hillocks there. He stopped there, looked to the right and the left, sketched something on the ground with his stick, and asked me to look for the signs of the tomb. As I did, I could notice the traces of the tomb of Imam `Ali (as). Imam al-Sadiq (as) immediately shed tears down his face and said these words",
