        "DESC: Ḥabīb b. Muẓāhir al-Asadī was one of Imam Ali's (a) special companions. He was from Banu Asad tribe and lived in Kufa. When he saw that people of Kufa have broken their allegiance to Imam al-Husayn (a), he left Kufa, joined Imam, and was martyred at the age of 75 while fighting in Imam al-Husayn's (a) army.",
