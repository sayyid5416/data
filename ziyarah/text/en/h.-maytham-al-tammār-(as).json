        "May Allāh curse your enemies till the Day of Judgement and may He fill their graves with fire and prepare for them a painful punishment",
        "I have come to you O’ pious servant, visiting your grave while recognising your right and adhering to your grace",
        "I ask Allāh in the name of the standing that you enjoy with Him to send his blessings upon Muḥammad and his family",
        "and fulfil our needs in this world and the next, and unite us amongst the successful ones with Muḥammad and his purified household",
        "Peace and blessings be upon you O martyr",
