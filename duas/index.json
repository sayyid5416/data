        "description": "Imam Sadiq (a.s) narrates that “one who recites this supplication for 40 mornings; he will be accounted amongst the helpers of Imam Mahdi (ajtfs). And if he happens to die before the reappearance of Imam Mahdi (ajtfs), Allah will raise him up from his grave so that he may assist the holy Imam (ajtfs).\n\nFor every word that he recites in this supplication, Allah will grant him 1000 good deeds and will erase from his scroll of deeds 1000 sins”. As the title suggests, this supplication is of allegiance (ahad) to the holy Imam (ajtfs). Its recitation every morning ensures the renewal of this covenant as taught by Imam Ali ibne Abi Talib (as)",

Imam Ali asked Kumayl to sit down, record and memorise the \"Du'a\" which Imam Ali dictated to Kumayl.\n\nImam Ali then advised Kumayl to recite this \"Du'a\" on the eve of (i.e. evening preceding) every Friday, or once a month or at least once in every year so that, added Imam Ali, \"Allah may protect thee from the evils of the enemies and the plots contrived by impostors. O' Kumayl! in consideration of thy companionship and understanding, I grant thee this honour of entrusting this \"Du'a\" to thee.\"",
